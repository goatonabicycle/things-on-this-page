# Things On This Page

This extension answers two questions. 
  1) "What can extensions see about me the things I browse?" 
  2) What are the most interesting things about this page?

This will get interesting information about the page that you're currently on. There's zero intention to track anything, rather, highlight what extensions have access to.

## How do I get it running?

```
npx vite
```

## What will this be in the future? 

I plan on adding many more things but this is ultimately just an interesting utility.
